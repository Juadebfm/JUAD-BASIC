        <h2 class="section-title">Brief History Of Juadeb Gabriel</h2>
        <p class="essay">
            That’s I have learned, from the very start, the importance of passion, dedication, confidence and time management. We are four brothers and sisters among our parents and my grandmother. My family is what my parents had worked for, ie completely happy and satisfied one.


 
I am the youngest of my only brother and two sisters. My elder brother is just six years elder in age than me. My other two elder sisters are younger than my brother. Being the eldest one, sometimes, gives you the favors. Luckily, I am loved, cared and most favored upon in my all family.


 
I am the students of high school. My elder brother studies in university. One elder sister of mine is the college student whereas the the youngest sister of mine is studying class 10. That’s, I go to school with my younger sister. I wake up early in the morning and finish up all of my doings on exact time. We all pack up for our respective works. My siblings prepare for school, college and university.


 
My father, for hospital and my mother for nearby school. The values like hard work, time management, sincerity with work and dedication to purpose have been ingrained in our nature. Its true to say that a child becomes what the environment he gets in his home. All the essential humane qualities like sincerity, dedication, truth and honesty I do experience practically at my home.


 
The school is a place that truly helps shaping one’s personality. My school is like another Godsend gift for me. It is one of the best school in our entire vicinity. We are truly cared, rightly educated and well socialized here at our school. I myself feel proud of being a student here. I do take care of what is being taught and what is to learn. I respect my teachers, my fellow beings, my school and every thing that is associated with my school.

I am a good student, who actively participates in all activities, be it exams or extra curricular activities. The extracurricular activities like sports, quiz competitions, essays and speech competitions etc. are the heart of my institution. I myself am essay competition winner on various times.

Truly it is said, one can not study from the books alone. Instead, one has to learn from all extracurricular activities in which one participates. I myself am the best essay writer, cricket player, singer and dancer and topper in all exams. The Career planning is the very thing that irritates oneself. Without a sound career planning, right from the start, one can not stay on the right track. One has to do the things or set the goals in accordance to his or her broad career goals.

A man without a sound career planning is like a ship without the radar. It drifts and ultimately sinks down in the deep ocean. But unlike my father, who is a doctor, I myself feel a little interest in this profession. Though it is the best profession but one’s interest and aptitude differs. I myself wants to be a Civil servant to serve my people in my best capacity.

I am very much inspired from my maternal uncle who is the chief of police force. That truly inspires me so as I myself want to serve my nation by being a good civil servant. One’s future can be determined by what one has achieved today or what one is doing today. A man who dreams only for future and does nothing for tomorrow can be best named as  lazy and the pathetic person.

In that way, I dislike myself being called as a man without a vision and castle maker in sky. I do work for what I dream. So far, I have proved myself being the best one in all fields like in academic, extracurricular and in personal domains. All of this success, hard work, dedication, determination is truly credited to my parents who have made this possible for me.

Successes and failures are closely associated with one’s achievements and losses. One who achieves anything today has lost a thing yesterday. There is no completely successful man without the mixture of both failures and successes. That is to say, I failed a dozen of times. But, every failure made me stronger ever.

My family, especially my mother, has been the much source of encouragement and motivation for me. That is why I myself am a truly self inspired, strengthened and dedicated fellow today. I have learnt a lot from my mistakes and from my failures. I never regard my failure as a curse rather an opportunity to improve and to improvise.

What I myself regard life is a total pot of opportunities. One has to harness one’s skills and abilities to the maximum of one’s capacity. For every problem there is a solution. I regard the life as a blessing gift to humanity. One should strive hard to improve not only his lot but for his fellow beings.

The service of humanity is the best of all services. What I have learnt myself from my experience and struggles is that one should never cease working hard, be confident, positive and adoptable to all situations. The biggest success is that one becomes invincible. Only than, one can face the life in a full vigor and fullest of confidence.

Therefore, writing about myself, I m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life is the total manifestation of what I do today. I try myself to be humble, passionate, dedicated, hardworking and honest. I deem my parents as being my best mentors. I have learnt the real meaning and worth of life from my parents. I am with a happy, focused and hardworking family. That is definitely the greatest blessing of God for me.
