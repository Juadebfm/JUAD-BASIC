        <h2 class="essay-title">Childhood</h2>
        <p class="essay">
        
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have learnt, from the very start, the importance of passion, dedication, confidence and time management. We are three brothers and a sister in a family of 6. My family is what my parents had worked for and hoped for, at least at the early stage growing up. We were completely happy and satisfied with the little my mom and dad could afford and for a lower income family, we werenʻt doing all that bad. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am the eldest of my siblings. My brother is four years younger than i am and so was the one after him. My sister was way younger anyway. 
Being the eldest son, sometimes, gives you the favors and priviledges that comes with leadership. Luckily, I am loved, cared for and the most favored upon in my all family (Iʻve always felt so), iʻm pretty confident that my siblings felt and still feel that way about themselves too. That was how much love my parents shared (equally) within the family. So growing up with love and freedom to pursue my dreams and interest made my childhood fun. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I still have fun memories about those times and i smile everytime i remember how proud my mom was that i could recite my memory verses, perform dramas, lead a choir or preach without skipping beats or making mistakes. I played music instruments like the piano, drums and percussive instruments and churches were coming to sign me up to their team. Those were fun proud moments i will cherish forever.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tetiary education was one of the hardest challenges iʻve ever faced. I wanted/ thought i wanted to be a medical doctor and i strived for it, but then i needed to pass JAMB (Joint admission and matriculation board) exams exceptionally well or have solid connects (which is usual in Nigeria my country) to get the admission for that. I failed a lot in that regards, did remedials in BUK (bayero university kano), almost failed. I was given library and information siences and i ignorantly refused to take it, that was the beginning of a very hard search for another admission. I did remedials in UNIMAID (university of maiduguri, borno state), did a 2 years diploma in Information Technology at the UNIMAID ICT center and earned a diploma (ND) with 4.3 CGPA, applied and got admission into civil engineering in 2012 at the height of the BH (boko haram) menace, dropped out at 200 level because i was afraid of Boko Haram and i was so sure iʻll die in maiduguri. Left maiduguri, came back to Kano, worked as an account officer at a polythene manufacturing company, raised money and i came down to the southwestern Nigeria to further my education. I got admission into Mechanical engineering 2014, i transferred to Transport management sciences after failing my 200 level exams in mechanical engineering. Faced with strikes, both internal and external strike, i spent over 7 years in LAUTECH before finally graduating with 3.4 cgpa in 2021. By then, i was too old for the NYSC program and i went full force into tech. Iʻm glad i did because i would not be here today writing, designing and deploying awesome websites and designs without this strenous journey at getting an education. I learnt a lot, met a lot of people and made loads of mistakes but this mistakes led me to the perfect me. They led me to my destiny. I became better and i developed myself, learnt self-sufficiency and became good at something i love and enjoy doing so much.
