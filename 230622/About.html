        <p class="essay">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have learned, from the very start, the importance of passion, dedication, confidence, and time management. We are three brothers and a sister in a family of 6. My family is what my parents had worked for and hoped for, at least at the early stage of growing up. We were happy and satisfied with the little my mom and dad could afford and for a lower-income family, we werenʻt doing all that bad.  I am the eldest of my siblings. My brother is four years younger than I am and so was the one after him. My sister was way younger anyway. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Being the eldest son, sometimes, gives you the favors and privileges that come with leadership. Luckily, I am loved, cared for, and the most favored in my all family (I've always felt so), iʻm pretty confident that my siblings felt and still feel that way about themselves too. That was how much love my parents shared (equally) within the family. So growing up with love and freedom to pursue my dreams and interest made my childhood fun. 
        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I still have fun memories about those times and I smile every time I remember how proud my mom was that I could recite my memory verses, perform dramas, lead a choir or preach without skipping beats or making mistakes. I played musical instruments like the piano, drums, and percussive instruments, and churches were coming to sign me up for their team. Those were fun proud moments I will cherish forever. Childhood are important because they shape you into what you'll become in adulthood. <br>

        <h3 class="section-title" id="section-tit">University Education</h3> 
        <p class="essay">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tertiary education was one of the hardest challenges iʻve ever faced.I wanted to be a medical doctor and I strived for it, but then I needed to pass JAMB (Joint admission and matriculation board) exceptionally or have solid connections (which was and still is common in Nigeria) to get the admission for that. I failed in that regard, did a remedial program in BUK (Bayero University Kano) and almost failed. I was given library and information sciences and I ignorantly refused to take it, that was the beginning of a very hard search for another admission. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I did a 2 years diploma in Information Technology at the UNIMAID ICT center and earned a diploma (ND) with 4.3 CGPA, applied and got admission into civil engineering in 2012 at the height of the BH (Boko Haram) menace, dropped out at 200 level because I was afraid of Boko Haram and I was so sure iʻll die in Maiduguri. I came back to Kano, worked as an account officer at a manufacturing company, raised money, and came down to southwestern Nigeria to further my education. I got admission into Mechanical engineering in 2014, i transferred to Transport management sciences after my 200-level exams. Faced with strikes, I spent over 7 years in LAUTECH before finally graduating in 2021. By then, I was too old for NYSC program and I went full force into tech. I started writing, designing, and deploying websites. I learned a lot, met a lot of people, and made loads of mistakes but these mistakes led me to the perfect point in life.

    <div class="span-col-2 essay-title-2">15 Ways to Become a Better Person Life is a journey and becoming better every day is the goal.
    </div>
    <!-- <p class="essay" style="width: 100%;">
        We've all made mistakes throughout our lives that haven't exactly put us in the best light--like bullying someone in school or telling what seemed like a little white lie. Chances are, however, you probably felt a little guilt and grew because of the situation.

        I'm an average guy trying to become better in both my work and home life. I'll never be perfect, but it doesn't mean I won't try.

        If you want to continue to grow as a person, here are 15 ways to make the most of yourself.
    </p> -->
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">1. Compliment Yourself</h2> 
        Every morning before you go on with your daily routine, take a couple of minutes to give yourself a compliment. Whether you compliment your outfit, haircut, or how you recently completed a task using your unique skill sets, giving yourself a little emotional boost will make you happy. And, when you're happy with yourself, that emotion can be contagious to those around you. Inspirational speaker Tony Robbins has a mantra he says aloud to himself most days to put him in a peak performance state.</div>

    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">2. Don't Make Excuses</h2>
        Blaming your spouse, boss, or clients is fruitless and won't get you very far. Instead of pointing fingers and making excuses about why you aren't happy or successful in your personal or professional life, own your mistakes and learn from them. When you do this, you will become a better person. When I personally started living up to my mistakes and downfalls, my life turned itself around. I became happier and healthier, and my relationship with my wife improved. We are happier than ever.</div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">3. Let Go of Anger</h2>
            Letting go of anger is easier said than done. While anger is a perfectly normal emotion, you can't let it fester. When this happens, you may make unwise decisions, and more important, it may affect your health. Research suggests pent up anger can cause digestive problems, difficulty sleeping, and even heart disease.

            To help you let go of anger, Roya R. Rad, MA, PsyD, suggests you write your feelings down, pray or meditate, or begin to manage your thoughts.
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">4. Practice Forgiveness</h2>
            Joyce Marter, LCPC, suggests you forgive and let go of resentment. She notes, "If for no other reason than for yourself, forgive to untether yourself from the negative experiences of the past. Take time to meditate, and give thanks for the wisdom and knowledge gained from your suffering. Practice the mantra, 'I forgive you and I release you.'"
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">5. Be Honest and Direct</h2>
            How would you feel if a loved one or business partner lied to you? Chances are you would see that as a violation of your trust. If you want to be a better person in either your personal or professional life, you should always tell the truth and state as clearly as possible what you are trying to convey. Learn to articulate your thoughts, feelings, and ideas in an open and honest manner.
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">6. Be Helpful</h2>
            Whether giving up your seat to an elderly person on the subway, assisting a co-worker on a project, or carrying in the groceries when your spouse comes back from the store, being helpful is one of the easiest and most effective ways to practice becoming a better person. I find that the more I help others, the better I feel about myself and everyone around me.
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">7. Listen to Others</h2>
            As Jeet Banerjee notes on Lifehack, "listening to people and giving everyone a voice is one of the greatest things you can do." He adds that he "got to meet some of the most amazing people, close some of the biggest deals, and develop connections that will last me a lifetime all because I took time to listen to people. Being a good listener can change your life in a positive manner."
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">8. Act Locally</h2>
            It may not seem like a big deal, but supporting a local cause, donating clothes, or buying from local farmers' markets or businesses are simple ways you can help your specific region. You may not be able to save the world, but you very well could make a difference in your neck of the woods. Get to know and care about your community.
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">9. Always Be Polite</h2>
            How much effort does it take to say, "Thank you," or to hold the elevator door open for someone? Not much at all. However, these acts of kindness can make someone's day. I decided a few years ago that it doesn't matter if someone is ultra rude, condescending, or worse. The way someone else behaves is not going to determine my behavior.
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">10. Be Yourself</h2>
            Tiffany Mason has five excellent reasons on Lifehack why you should be yourself. These include being able to align yourself with your values and beliefs, establish your identity, build courage, create boundaries, and find focus and direction.
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">11. Be Open to Change</h2>
            Whether trying a new restaurant, traveling to an unknown part of the world, or doing something that has always scared you, you should always be open to change. This allows you to grow because you experience something new. It helps you be high functioning and self-confident if you are not wary of change.
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">12. Be Respectful</h2>
            How would you feel if you had just cleaned your home and someone came in and tracked mud everywhere? You'd probably be a little ticked that they hadn't taken off their shoes. Take this mentality and apply it to everyday life. For example, don't toss your trash or cigarette butts on the floor of public restrooms or sidewalks just because someone else will clean it up. Be respectful of others' time, thoughts, ideas, lifestyles, feelings, work, and everything else. You don't have to agree with any of it, but people have a right to their opinions and yours is not necessarily correct.
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">13. Don't Show Up Empty-handed</h2>
            Going to a party this weekend at your friend's apartment? Make sure you don't arrive empty-handed. Even if you've been assured that there will be plenty of food and drink, bring along a little something to show you appreciate being invited.
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">14. Educate Yourself</h2>
            If you don't understand why one country is invading another, take the time to educate yourself on the current event. Ask a person intimately connected with the event for his or her thoughts. Remember, we're all interconnected, and being aware of different cultures, different people, and what their lives are like can make you a more well-rounded individual. This will also help you understand points of view different from your own.
    </div>
    <!-- <div class="essay">
        <h2 class="essay-title-2">15. Surprise People</h2>
        How good does it feel to make someone smile? It feels pretty good, right? Surprise your loved ones or co-workers now and then, with a gift, a night out on the town, or by offering help when you know they could use it.

        Becoming a better person doesn't happen overnight, but it is possible. Believe in yourself and know that it is possible!

        What other tips have you found useful for becoming a better person?
